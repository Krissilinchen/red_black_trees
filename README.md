This repository contains an implementation of so-called RedBlackTrees, a kind of self-balancing binary tree.
The advantage of RedBlackTrees over the normal binary search trees is a better runtime behavior, i.e. important operations like searching the minimum, inserting or searching for an element have only a logarithmic runtime behavior instead of -- in the worst case scenario -- a linear runtime behavior.
